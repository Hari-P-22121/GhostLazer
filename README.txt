GhostLazer is a Denial Of Service tool for stress testing. 

GhostLazer floods systems through ping flooding. GhostLazer is able to go past the limit without requiring root privileges allowed by having multiple threads. This means that GhostLazer will have multiple ping sessions open. The number of sessions is known as threads which the user can enter and choose. There is no limit. The user must enter a number.

When the software starts, the client will have to enter an IP/Hostname that will be stress tested. Then they must enter how many to send per thread (MAX: 8000 bytes). Then they have to enter the total number of threads. After this, they are required to enter how many times to send ping the host. (NOTE: The total of bytes being sent can be calculated by multiplying the 3 values above.) Then there is the delay between each shot. The shorter the delay, the faster the bytes will be sent and the more effective.
